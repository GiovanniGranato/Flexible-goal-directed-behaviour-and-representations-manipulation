# Internal-representations-and-Flexible-goal-directed-behaviour

This project investigates the relation between the internal representations (e.g. the perceptual representation of the external world), flexible cognition and the flexible goal-directed behaviour. In particular, here we study the "representations manipulation", i.e. how the brain of an embodied agent can flexibly online manipulate the own internal representation to achieve a goal.

In particular, this repository contains a computational model that corroborates the "three-components theory of flexible cognition" in Granato and Baldassarre (2021). A video of the computational model that solves a neuropsychological task (Wisconsin Cards Sorting Tests, a neurpsychological task that measures the flexible cognition) is avaiable on https://youtu.be/pnBWWqhULsE.

The repository is organized in this way:

Main: # Main file to run to execute the WCST

-- Environment # Functions to draw the graphical enviroment

-- System_Components # Components of the model (e.g. fovea, working-memory, etc...)

-- Analysis_Tools_WCST # Graphics functions and tools to score the WCST behavioural indices

-- geometricshapes # Graphics files

-- System_files # Files of model's components (e.g. networks weights)
